# In Need of Simple Documentation / How-To
I forked this trainer repository because I have no idea how it works or how to use it.  The creator didn't provide any documentation or readme, or any info when I contacted them (via the annoying method of pull-request-as-direct-message), and there was no issues/discussion/wiki.  If anyone can explain how to use this trainer after looking at the code, do please add any documentation/info that you'd like to offer here, I think it would be helpful to people.

To make any info contributions as easy as possible, I've activated:
- Unrestricted wiki
- Discussions area
- Issues

I have no programming skills or understanding though I've contributed to projects in documentation and images/thumbnails.
