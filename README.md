# In Need of Documentation/How-To
I forked this trainer repository because I have no idea how it works or how to use it.  The creator didn't provide any documentation or readme, or any info when I contacted them (via the annoying method of pull-request-as-direct-message).  If anyone can explain how to use this trainer after looking at the code, do please add any documentation/info that you'd like to offer here, I think it would be helpful to people.
