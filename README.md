# In Need of Simple Documentation / How-To
I forked this trainer repository because I have no idea how it works or how to use it.  The creator didn't provide any documentation or readme, or any info when I contacted them (via the only available option of annoying pull-request-as-direct-message regretably), and there was no issues/discussion/wiki.  **If anyone can explain how to use this trainer** after looking at the code, do please add any documentation/info that you'd like to offer in one of the areas below, I think it would be helpful to people.

To make any info contributions as easy as possible, I've activated:
- Unrestricted **Wiki**
- **Discussions** area
- **Issues** area

When I ran the exe, both before and after running RPCS3 & Demon's Souls, nothing happened that I could perceive.

# Virus Scan?
For what it's worth, the packaged exe of the original looks clean in anti-virus.

# Bio Note
I have no programming skills or understanding though I've contributed to projects in documentation and images/thumbnails and support.  If I can help you (reader) in some way, let me know.
