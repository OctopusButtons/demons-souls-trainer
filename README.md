# In Need of Simple Documentation / How-To
I forked this trainer repository from https://github.com/13xforever/demons-souls-trainer because I have no idea how to use it.  The creator didn't provide any documentation or readme, and confirmed they're not interested in providing info when I contacted them, and there was no issues/discussion/wiki.  **If anyone can explain how to use this trainer** after looking at the code, do please add any documentation/info that you'd like to offer in one of the areas below, or by pull request to this Readme, I think it would be helpful to people.

To make any info contributions as easy as possible, I've activated:
- Unrestricted **Wiki**
- **Discussions** area
- **Issues** area

When I ran the exe, both before and after running RPCS3 & Demon's Souls, nothing happened that I could perceive.

# Virus Scan = Clean

For what it's worth, the packaged exe of the original looks clean in anti-virus.  Though you should be following good practice and always scanning your executables.

# Bio Note
I have no programming skills or understanding though I've contributed to projects in documentation, databases, images/thumbnails, and support.  If I can help you (reader) in some way, or in exchange for documentation of the Demon's Souls Trainer, let me know.
